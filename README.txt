Welcome to "Python - The Next Level". I'm your instructor, Aaron Maxwell.
Reach me at aaron@powerfulpython.com.

This folder has course materials you will use in the class:

* PythonTheNextLevel.pdf - Extensive written material on the topics
  covered in the course, and more! Use to review and deepen your
  learning after class, or as a reference when doing the programming
  exercises (labs).

* slides - Slide decks used in the class.

* labs - In-class programming exercises. Your instructor will lead you
  through them.

* py3/labs - The Python 3.x lab set.

* py2/labs - The Python 2.7 lab set.

* solutions - Solutions to the labs. IMPORTANT: We've found that students learn
  and retain as much as TEN TIMES MORE when they only look at solutions as a
  last resort, peeking only for a hint to get un-stuck. Always do as much as
  you can on your own, so you'll learn a lot!

FURTHER READING

(Both books below are written primarily for Python 3, with commentary mixed in
on how Python 2 differs, as needed.)

* Powerful Python: The Most Impactful Patterns, Features, And Development
  Strategies Modern Python Provides, by Aaron Maxwell
  https://powerfulpython.com/store/powerful-python-book/

  My own book. You already have about half of it, in the courseware PDF.  If
  you sign up for "Python - Beyond The Basics", the other course I teach
  through O'Reilly, you'll get most of the remainder as part of its courseware.
  The book covers nearly every topic covered in both courses, in many cases
  more deeply, plus bonus chapters.

* Powerful Python Blog
  https://powerfulpython.com/blog/

  In-depth articles on intermediate to advanced Python
  programming. For several, I wrote full custom applications to
  demonstrate some concept, pattern or set of features, and how they
  are used in real-world Python software.

* The Python Cookbook (3rd ed.), by Beazly and Jones
  http://www.amazon.com/dp/1449340377/

  Excellent book which, when used over time, will take you all the way from
  intermediate to advanced Python developer. Keep on your desk, right by your
  computer.
